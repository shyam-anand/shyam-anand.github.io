                <p>I'm a Software Engineer, currently working at Google, Hyderabad. Previously I've been with several startups, mostly in technical leadership roles.<br/>
                  I enjoy working on high level design for large scale software systems. I'm particularly interested in distributed systems. 
                  I've also managed engineering teams in two startups, while being hands-on coder.
                </p>
                <p>I like music, particularly <a href="https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/heavydistortion/pl.u-qxylKq6TdZkBbz">Heavy Metal, and the like</a>.
                  A few of my favourite artists are Opeth, Slayer, Megadeth, Metallica, and Pink Floyd.
                </p>
                <p>I like to read. I'm currently reading <em>A Memory Called Empire</em> by Arkady Martine. Some of my favourite books are
                  <em>Thinking: Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman,
                  <em>The Black Swan</em> by Nassem Taleb,
                  <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari,
                  <em>Brief Answers to the Big Questions</em> by Stephen Hawking,
                  <em>Solaris by Lanislaw Lem</em> by Amor Towles, and the Foundation series by Asimov. I have yet to read The Lord of the Rings.
                </p>
                <p>I like taking pictures, and I occasionally post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/optimal.exposure/">Instagram</a>.</p>
