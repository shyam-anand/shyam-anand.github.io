                  <p>I'm a Software Engineer, curently living in Hyderabad, India.</p>
                  <p>I work at Google Hyderabad, since the last week of September.
                    I was a Software Architect at Turvo previously, and with 4 other startups before that.

                <p>
                  I code in Java most of the time. I enjoy mostly technical roles with involvement largely in high level design for large scale software systems.
                  I'm particularly interested in distributed systems. I've also managed engineering teams in two startups, while being hands-on coder.
                </p>
                <p>I like music, particularly <a href="https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/heavydistortion/pl.u-qxylKq6TdZkBbz">Heavy Metal, and the like</a>.
                  A few of my favourite artists are Opeth, Slayer, Megadeth, Metallica, and Pink Floyd.
                </p>
                <p>I like to read. I'm currently reading <em>A Memory Called Empire</em> by Arkady Martine. Some of my favourite books are
                  <em>Thinking: Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman,
                  <em>The Black Swan</em> by Nassem Taleb,
                  <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari,
                  <em>Brief Answers to the Big Questions</em> by Stephen Hawking,
                  <em>Solaris by Lanislaw Lem</em> by Amor Towles, and the Foundation series by Asimov. I have yet to read The Lord of the Rings.
                </p>
                <p>I like taking pictures, and I occasionally post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/optimal.exposure/">Instagram</a>.</p>
