                  I'm a Software Engineer Consultant at <a href="https://pyyne.com">Pyyne</a>, Stockholm. <br/>
                  I moved to Stockholm in February 2024. Before that I was at Google, and at several startups before that, mostly in technical leadership roles.<br/>
                  I enjoy working on high level design for large scale software systems. I'm particularly interested in distributed systems. 
                  I've also managed engineering teams in two startups, while being a hands-on coder.
                </p>
                <p>I like music, particularly Heavy Metal, and the likes. Here's my playlist on Spotify:

                </p>
                <p>I like to read, especially sci-fi. I'm currently reading <em>Consider Phlebas (The Culture series)</em> by Iain M. Banks. Some of my favourite books are
                  <em>The Expanse series</em> by James S. A. Corey,
                  <em>Solaris by Lanislaw Lem</em> by Amor Towles, and the Foundation series by Asimov. I have yet to read The Lord of the Rings.
                  <em>The Foundation series</em> by Asimov,
                  <em>Murderbot series</em> by Martha Wells,
                  <em>Children of Time</em> by Adrian Tchaikovsky,
                  <em>Project Hail Mary</em> by Andy Weir,
                  <em>Thinking: Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman,
                  <em>Brief Answers to the Big Questions</em> by Stephen Hawking,
                  <em>Sapiens</em> by Yuval Noah Harari,
                </p>
